# Xorberax's Banks
Adds banks to the towns of Calradia. You can maintain individual 
balances at each towns' bank, and take out loans. Banks offer weekly 
interest rates to provide a passive income and an incentive to bank with
them over other towns. There are risks with banking however, as your
Denars are stored in the town's treasury, and is subject to loss in 
events such as sieges, theft, or mismanagement.

## Configuration
